One of the earliest concepts relevant to machine learning was the idea of \"cybernetics,\" introduced in the 1940s.

The real power of decision trees, however, became evident with the introduction of ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting. Ensemble methods combine multiple machine learning models to improve accuracy and overcome individual weaknesses. This approach marked a significant step forward, demonstrating that combining multiple simple models could achieve better performance than any single model alone.\n"
