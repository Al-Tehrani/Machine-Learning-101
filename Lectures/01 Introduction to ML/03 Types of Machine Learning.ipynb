The goal is to learn a function that maps input data to the correct output labels. Supervised Learning is commonly used for tasks such as regression and classification.\n",

The learning agent takes actions in the environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. Reinforcement Learning is commonly used for tasks such as game playing, robotics, and sequential decision-making problems.\n"
