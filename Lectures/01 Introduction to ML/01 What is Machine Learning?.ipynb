    "Machine Learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence, has its roots dating back to the 1950s. In 1952, Arthur Samuel coined the term \"Machine Learning\" while working on a checkers-playing program at IBM. He defined it as the \"field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\" In the following decades, researchers explored various approaches to Machine Learning, such as the Perceptron algorithm (1957) and the Nearest Neighbor algorithm (1967). However, it wasn't until the 1990s that Machine Learning gained significant traction, thanks to the advent of more powerful computers and the availability of larger datasets. Since then, Machine Learning has experienced rapid growth and has become an integral part of our daily lives.\n"

After training, the model can accurately classify new, unseen images into the appropriate categories.\n",
