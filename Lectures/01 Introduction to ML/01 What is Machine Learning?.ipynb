    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.\n"

    "The distinction between machine learning and traditional programming lies in their approach to solving problems and processing data. In traditional programming, a programmer codes all the rules in consultation with experts in a specific domain for the task at hand. The program then follows these rules to process data and produce outputs. The logic and instructions are explicitly defined by the programmer, and the computer follows these instructions.\n"

    "In contrast, machine learning uses data to generate the rules. Instead of programming the computer every step of the way, the machine learning model is trained on a dataset. It learns the patterns and relationships within the data, building its own logic based on the data it is fed. In essence, the machine learning model generates its own rules to make predictions or decisions, rather than following a set of manually programmed instructions. This allows machine learning models to adapt to new, unseen data, making predictions or decisions based on its training.\n"

    "This fundamental difference highlights the adaptive and predictive power of machine learning, which traditional programming lacks. Machine learning is particularly powerful in scenarios where the rules for decision-making are complex or unknown, and the amount of data is too vast for manual rule setting. Such a dynamic approach enables applications ranging from self-driving cars, which must navigate an ever-changing environment, to personalized recommendations on streaming services, where user preferences need to be predicted without explicit programming."
