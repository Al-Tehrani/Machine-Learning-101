    "In machine learning, evaluating the performance of a model is crucial to understanding its effectiveness and making informed decisions about its deployment. Model evaluation metrics provide quantitative measures to assess how well a model performs on a given task. These metrics help us compare different models, tune hyperparameters, and select the best model for our specific problem.\n"
